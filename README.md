5. Write a Java program to remove strings that start with a specific word from a list using streams. 
6. Find the first element in a list that starts with a particular letter                         
7. Get the length of each name in a list                                                         
8. Get the even/odd numbers from an array of numbers and list of numbers          
9. Get the even/odd numbers between a range                                       
10. Sort a list of integers in descending/ascending order                           
11. Calculate the sum and average of numbers in an array and list of numbers         
12. Find the maximum/minimum number in an array/list of numbers                  
            
Intermediate

1. Sort the list of strings based on their lengths in ascending/descending order. 
2. Find the longest word in the list.                                            
3. Get the list of strings having vowels                                       
4. convert a list of strings into a single string, separated by commas, using streams  
5. Write a Java program to create a new list of strings, where each string is reversed from the original list, using Java streams.  
6. Write a Java program to remove all strings from the list that are empty or null using streams.                    
7. Remove duplicate elements from an array/list of integers          
8. Convert a list/array of integers to a list of their squares and print them  
9. Find the sum of squares of all the numbers in the array/list.        
10. Get the second largest number and second smallest  number in a list/array 
11. Get the first number greater than 50 in a list/array              

Advanced
1. Given a list of strings, group a list of strings by the first letter of each string using streams  
2. Given a list of strings, group a list of strings by the length of the string                      
3. Given a list of strings, create a map where the key is the first letter of the string, and the value is a list of strings that start with that letter using streams    
4. Given a list of strings, group the list of strings with vowels and no vowels into two lists 
5. Given a list of strings print only the string elements excluding the digits using streams.  
6. Given a list of strings find the first element having the length as 10 if not handle exceptions 
7. Reverse the list of strings using streams api 
8. Get the sum of numbers of a two dimensional array and list of list of integers  
9. Convert an array of integers into a map where the key is the number and the value is its square 
10. Partition an array of integers into two groups: even and odd using Streams. 
11. Calculate the product of all numbers in the array using reduce 
12.implement a parallel stream that computes the sum of squares of numbers in an array.
